        <h3>What is AnaphoraCore?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>AnaphoraCore is an online <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphora_(linguistics)">anahpora/coreference</a> resolution solution.</li>
            <li>It requires no tagging, it can analyze the sentences on its own.</li>
            <li>It uses machine learning technique support vector machine, Microsoft Linguistics API, asp.net Core MVC technologies.</li>
            <li>AnaphoraCore is an open source program licenced under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">GNU Public Licence v4</a>. It's source code can be accessed through <a href="https://github.com/callofktulu/AnaphoraCore">here</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Bibliography and digital sources for this work</h3>
            <p>To tackle the problem I have studied several publications. Note that I haven't used any of the algorithms that are presented in these articles. This is one of the reasons why I am making this project open source:</p>
            <ul>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Version notes for v0.1</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The project is pushed to GitHub.</li>
            <li>The algorithm for detecting and parsing clauses are in effect.</li>
            <li>Algorithm explanation has been added to the source code functions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Planned Updates</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I will apply to Microsoft Cognitive Services showcase.</li>
            <li>Machine learning algorithm will be further developed.</li>
            <li>The sentences will be recorded and human revision will be asked after each analysis.</li>
            <li>The user login will be implemented for statistics & machine learning algorithm.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Known Bugs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The system performs poorly (or it doesn't work at all) when the pronoun refers to a non-person noun. This will be fixed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Special Thanks</h3>
        <p>Special thanks to Claire Peeters and Mariana Vignioli for helping me test the application and special thanks to <a href="http://wdb.ugr.es/~cristoballozano/">Dr. Cristóbal Lozano</a> for laying the foundations of this work. </p>
        <h3>Contact and Donations</h3>
        <p>AnaphoraCore is a free-to-use and open source application. I have some further plans to develop it of which you can check at Planned Updates section. However development takes time and server management which costs money, and I am a graduate student with low income. Would you like to help me develop it further? Donations will surely motivate me in developing AnaphoraCore and other linguistic tools!</p>
